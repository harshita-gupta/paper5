Now he could not restrain himself. It would be a shock, of course. What had happened? Her women had no way of knowing when the line had been crossed. One morning Genji was up early and Murasaki stayed on and on in bed. It was not at all like her to sleep so late. Might she be unwell? As he left for his own rooms, Genji pushed an inkstone inside her bed curtains. At length, when no one else was near, she raised herself from her pillow and saw beside it a tightly folded bit of paper. Listlessly she opened it. There was only this verse, in a casual hand: “Many have been the nights we have spent together Purposelessly, these coverlets between us.” She had not dreamed he had anything of the sort on his mind. What a fool she had been, to repose her whole confidence in so gross and unscrupulous a man. It was almost noon when Genji returned. “They say you’re not feeling well. What can be the trouble? I was hoping for a game of Go.” She pulled the covers over her head. Her women discreetly withdrew. He came up beside her. “What a way to behave, what a very unpleasant way to behave. Try to imagine, please, what these women are thinking.” He drew back the covers. She was bathed in perspiration and the hair at her forehead was matted from weeping. “Dear me. This does not augur well at all.” He tried in every way he could think of to comfort her, but she seemed genuinely upset and did not offer so much as a word in reply. “Very well. You will see no more of me. I do have my pride.” He opened her writing box but found no note inside. Very childish of her — and he had to smile at the childishness. He stayed with her the whole day, and he thought the stubbornness with which she refused to be comforted most charming.
