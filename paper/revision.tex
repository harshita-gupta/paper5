My conversation with Professor Miller helped to identify some key concerns with the experiments I was engaging in and why this was causing difficulty in interpretation. As he put it, I had ``too many degrees'' to my experiments, and was applying the meta-processes of close reading to experimental, almost scientific exploration, which needed, as he said, ''more controls``. I reduced the translations I was dealing with, reduced the role of the graphs and visuals in my interpretation, and focused on using preexisting analyses as my axes upon which to make interpretive moves or pivots. 

In developing this revision, I used Franco Moretti's ``Network Theory, Plot Analysis'' from \booktitle{Distant Reading} as a model of a work in a similar genre. The day after our conference, I was finally able to get my network code to work, and figured out how to visualize topics as a graph connecting different words and elements across texts. This gave me a very productive experimental setup for understanding what I'd been interested in all along, the unique thematic 'structure' of each of the texts. As Moretti says in his analysis of Hamlet through a network of its plot,

\begin{displayquote}
Finally - and it is the most important thing of all, but also the most difficult - one can intervene on a model; make experiments. Take the protagonist again. For literary critics, this figure is important because it is a very meaningful part of the text; there is always a lot to be said about it; we would never think of discussing Hamletâ€”without Hamlet. But this is exactly what network theory tempts us to do: take the Hamlet-network, and remove Hamlet, to see what happens.
\end{displayquote}

I engage in this process of "making experiments" on the networks that I produce, by deleting different variations of words like 'women', 'daughter', 'mother', and 'mistress', and subsequently understanding their effect on the network: to put it differently: I attempt to understand each translation with questions like ``What remains of the of each translation's depiction of women when we remove mentions of all male - associated women, like mothers, wives, and daughters?'' ``Do women remain in the networks, and to what extent, when we remove mentions of courtly duties and performance, versus when we remove mentions of feeling, emotion, and thought?'' How does each translation's network respond differently to these interventions? Engaging with the models in this way was the most challenging part of HUM10 all year, since it was unlike anything I've done before; it was very difficult to think of productive questions that would reveal interesting trends, write code to answer the questions, wait for it to run, and analyze my results thoughtfully without getting lost in the 80 or so files that each run of code would generate. \linebreak

When I cleaned the models according to the interests I expressed in draft, removing some rogue proper nouns and publishers notes, many of the trends that I'd identified in my draft, like the difference in occurrences of women, were no longer present. Generating the models with the parts of speech that I detected earlier, and with the topic number setting set to 15, also yielded cleaner, more meaningful topics that didn't have as many unreadable words or errors. Additionally, instead of simply using the top ten words in a topic, I used a threshold value to determine whether the topics coherence was statistically significant (threshold signal value); I felt like this was a representation that relied on a more rigorous understanding of the model's output.\linebreak

I think much of the difficulty with this paper was that I'm not as well trained in reading and interpreting models as I am in close-reading --- setting out on this project was a challenge in both, the model-creation respect, as well as in learning to productively and accurately interpret topic signals and force-directed network graphs. \linebreak

Given more time and resources, I would certainly give these models and their results a more thorough treatment, with perhaps a more ``mesoanalytic'' lens --- since I wasn't able to read all four translations in depth, and was only interacting with models, the traditionalist in me (however small a part that may be) finds the result only partly satisfying. I would want to endeavor to correlate my network's results with clearer plot and thematic trends across the text, versus ones in specific scenes that the topics can point out; this would only be doable once I've read the entirety of each text.

In Metonymy in The Tale of Genji: An Analysis of Translation Strategies, Janel R. Goodman Murakami compares occurrences of metonymy in a passage across translations of the Tale of Genji to assess how domesticated or foreignized Suematsu's, Waley's, Seidensticker's, and Tyler's translations are, concluding that the more modern translators retain foreign elements of the text more faithfully than their earlier counterparts. In ``Going to Bed with Waley: How Murasaki Shikibu does and does not become world literature,'' Valerie Henitiuk uses a similar microanalytic approach, more commonly referred to as close-reading, to analyze the scene of Genji's and Murasaki's consummation. She argues that while Seidensticker's  portrayal of the scene as rape and an act of aggression may initially appear feminist and progressive, portraying the scene as such an out-of-sorts one, it loses the opportunity to employ the ``far more subtle and thus profound criticism... to explore the insidious social problems at the very root of situations like this'' (Henitiuk 56). Seidensticker's portrayal, as well as Tyler's (though to a lesser extent), emphasizes the difficulties of the specific situation over the system at large, missing the larger social commentary that Murasaki Shikibu is making, or the ``true critique being leveled at prevailing attitudes and behaviors''. A successful critique, would be ``implicit but no less scathing'' (Henitiuk 57).

Henitiuk's conclusions are drawn based on close readings of a select few passages from each translation, a very microscopic approach for a text as varied and large in scope as \booktitle{Genji}. Her argument is based on the understanding that Seidensticker and Tyler misstep by setting apart this scene from the rest of the novel; Henitiuk is thereby relying on a fundamentally macroanalytic understanding of each translation's baseline for representing interactions amongst characters. This is where a definitively macroanalytic approach offered by computational analysis is useful. My paper draws out and tests the underlying assumptions to Henitiuk's microanalysis by offering a holistic, modeled understanding of each translation's thematic world to shed light on the portrayal of the morning-after scene in juxtaposition to the text as a whole. I ultimately discover TODO

In my endeavor to, like Murakami, evaluate the thematic and linguistic domestication versus foreignization of a translation, I turn to a work referenced by Henitiuk in ``Going to Bed With Waley,'' Margaret H Childs' ``The Value of Vulnerability: Sexual Coercion and the Nature of Love in Japanese Court.'' Childs analyzes the ``cross-cultural emotional experience'' and highlights the difference between modern American expectations of love and premodern Japanese literary representations of it. Her preliminary statements are about general categories of emotion, drawing attention to studies that show that the American schemas of emotion differ from Chinese ones in their inclusion of surprise, while Chinese ones differ from the American in their inclusion of shame, but the crux of her discussion is around the un-American category of loving feelings called 'sad love' depicted in Japanese literature, which is associated with negative emotions and words like 'pity' and 'pathetic'. There is a high correlation between fragility and beauty, and vulnerability and attraction.

Using Childs' research to set up these measurable variables to determine the ``westernization'' of a text --- through its cooccurring depiction of love and negative emotion --- sets the stage for technical models to take over and offer information about where each text falls on the spectrum of domestic to foreign. The appropriate tool for an analysis of negative emotion is sentiment analysis, a natural language processing tool that determines the positive or negative polarity of a word. I conducted sentiment analyses on the three translations in concern and displayed a histogram of the results for each text. \footnote{All sentiment scores with an absolute value of less than 0.0001 were excluded from the graphs, since they provide no interpretive value.}

\begin{figure}

    \caption{Positive and Negative Sentiment Across \booktitle{Genji}}
    \label{sentiment-hists}
\end{figure}

An analysis of the histograms, along with the mean, median, and variance of the data, shows that Seidensticker's text is markedly more variant in its depiction of emotion, with a heavier clustering of values towards the edges of the graph than the other two texts. All the graphs have a much smaller mean than a median, which shows that the mean is skewed by some very low sentiment scores --- this is no surprise, as any reader of \booktitle{Genji} can surmise that the book is rife with dramatic, often heart-wrenching emotion. The presence of negative emotion in a plot filled with romantic entanglements suggests that the texts are reasonably close to Childs' understanding of Eastern-language texts' depictions of love, but a simple sentiment analysis reveals only the presence of negative emotion across the entirety of the text's plot, not that it occurs in romantic contexts. To determine whether there is meaningful cooccurrence between negative-sentiment-scoring words and love, or in other words, whether the translation is true to ``sad love,'' I turn to topic modeling. 

I apply digital topic modeling to break down and analyze the three translations of Genji in concern: Edward G. Seidensticker's from 1976, Royall Tyler's from 2001, and Dennis Washburn's from 2015 \footnote{ My greatest interest was originally in comparing the work of male translators with Helen McCullough's partial translation. Unfortunately, McCullough's translation, published only in \booktitle{Genji and Heike: selections from the Tale of Genji and the Tale of the Heike}, is heavily copyrighted and unavailable in any digital format.}. Topic modeling is a natural language processing technique that uses the principle of distributional semantics, or the common cooccurrence of two words, to group words into ``topics.'' I use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling method, which operates on 1000-word sequential chunks of the tale of Genji. LDA treats each ``chunk'' of words as an entity composed of ``topics'' ---Â each topic is composed of words that commonly occur together. A statistical explanation of LDA modeling's assumptions and mechanisms is beyond the scope of this paper, and one can turn to Rhody's ``Unpacking the Assumptions of LDA'' or Jockers' Macroanalysis for a simplified analysis of the method. Crucial to this paper and its discussion, however, is LDA modeling's unsupervised nature. Topics are not produced based on the program's understanding of the words' meanings or potential similarity, but creates buckets for topics based on the position of words relative to each other, and their common cooccurrence, i.e. distributional similarity, to determine that they belong to a similar topic. Its unsupervised nature makes LDA modeling useful for identifying topics in a more ``objective'' fashion by identifying authors' subconscious placement of words and themes and therefore reflecting their gendered and cultural inclinations. Topic modeling is useful, therefore, not just due to ability to give us a zoomed-out, abstracted view of a text as large as Genji, but also in uncovering topics that might be outside our microanalysis-based understanding of discoverable topics.

Topic modeling is traditionally applied to multiple documents that are dissimilar, as in the work by Jockers, and has been trained on corpuses containing multiple texts, 4500 poems in Rhody's case and 4500 texts in Jockers' case. These models develop generalized, often easily identifiable themes that can apply to texts across time and author, like Rhody's ``night light moon stars day dark'' and ``tree green summer flowers grass'' topics. Jockers' and Rhody's topics reveal nothing surprising in their content themselves; the combinations of words are predictable. Topic modeling of the form they practice is useful when the purpose of the topics, albeit predictable, is to be used later in topic distribution comparison across texts, but is less useful when working with a single text. I train the LDA model, instead, on a single translation of Genji at a time, thereby developing topics that are far more specific to each translation's ``thematic world,'' and useful in identifying the thematic differences underlying each translation. The interpretive advantage to this method is evident in the difference between the topics generated by the two cited authors, and the ones I display and analyze in my paper.

Developing meaningful topics is not just a matter of corpus scale, but also of corpus content: following Jockers' guidance, I remove all stop words that do not provide interpretive value, like articles and pronouns, from the corpus before I discover themes within it. In ``Theme'', Jockers proposes and demonstrates topic modeling only on a corpus of common nouns. Restricting the corpus to nouns is appropriate in his use case as his corpus is much larger than a single \booktitle{Genji} translation, and therefore filtering for nouns allows for a higher level of abstraction that focuses on broader trends that are more likely to occur across hundreds of texts. In analyzing \booktitle{Genji}, however, restricting my models to only nouns results in a loss of rich nuance which is central to a cross-translation comparison: adjectives, adverbs, and verbs contain a wealth of information about emotion, description, and subjectivity. To this end, I include adverbs, adjectives, and verbs in my topic models.\footnote{ In addition to removing stop words and parts of speech other than the ones specified, I removed all annotations, introductions, publishers' notes, footnotes,Â and endnotes. In the Tyler translation, this included the deletion of all chapter titles that are not from the original, chapter introductions, and the ``Persons'' and ``Relationship to Previous Chapters'' sections. Additionally, all words are reduced to their stems - therefore treating ``respect'' and ``respectfully'' as identical semantic units and indistinguishable to the LDA algorithm. I also exclude all proper nouns from the corpus used for the topic model, so that topics are identified not upon the basis of scene (which correlates highly with proper nouns like names and places) but upon common motifs. Special care was taken to exclude all Japanese proper nouns, which are not identified by Western natural language processing tools. For a list of all Japanese proper nouns removed, see the code in Appendix A.} The topics discovered, with the words that have the highest percentage of appearance within a given topic, are included in figures \ref{seidensticker-topics}, \ref{tyler-topics}, and \ref{washburn-topics} \footnote{All words in a given topic with signal strength greater than 0.0040 are included, i.e. words that comprise more than four percent of a given topic. If a topic had no words with signal strengths high enough, i.e. the topic was statistically insignificant, those topics were excluded from the final model and not used in subsequent discussion.}.

The topic model offers a probabilistically-sound way of determining association between concepts like pity and love: if they cooccur in a topic, they do so because the model has identified that they are distributionally similar and closely codependent within the thematic world of the corpus, in this case a single translation of Genji. To further study the existence of ``sad love'' across the translations, I generate a list of the ten most negative words in each translation, and then feed these words to the topic models and determine which topics each word is most likely to occur in --- more of the words occurring in topics about love or romance is taken as a quantitative indicator of ``sad love.'' My results are detailed in figures \ref{seidensticker-sentiment-topics}, \ref{tyler-sentiment-topics}, and \ref{washburn-sentiment-topics}. \footnote{Words that had no strong association with any topic were not included.}

In Seidensticker, the correlation between negative words and romantic and love-focused themes is weak: the topics have stray mentions of women, but are much more ceremony-focused and court-focused (see topic 14 and 2) and ceremony-focused. In Tyler, there is a high correlation of nature and music with negative sentiment, but only one of the first five topics (topic 7) can be connected to love and romance. In Washburn's translation, however, all of the first five negative-correlated themes are romantic or love-focused, with words like 'feel', 'heart', 'dream', and 'emot', and 'deep.'

-- find some model that confirms this, and then see where the Washburn fits into that model, therefore see where we can place Washburn on the scale
Or use Childs' frameworks to offer a different foreign v domestic progression, and then see where Washburn fits into that
models to try: test for words child suggests among the topics
differences between the topics 

Once we know the domestic v foreign thing about these texts, what does this reveal about Henitiuk's reading? Where does Washburn fit in?

I build on the preexisting body of scholarship on Japanese to English translations of Genji, instead using the macroanalytic approach of topic modeling, to compute the themes across the translations, and analyze what discrepancy between translations reflects about the text's portrayal of women. TODO EXPAND ON WHAT EXACTLY I ultimately build upon Murakami's conclusion, determining that more recent translations not only portray Heian Japan more faithfully, but also elevate the position of women as individuals without ``censor[ing],'' as Henitiuk put it, male-female interactions to the same degree as older ones. TODO WHAT TYPE OF CENSORING, STAKES BECOME MORE CLEAR W DETAILS

Moreover, Henitiuk's argument is challenged by the fact that Seidensticker's translation scores lower on sentiment: if Seidensticker's language across the novel skews more negative than Tyler's, or in other words, he has a different emotional intensity baseline, does Henitiuk's arguement about his usage of words like ``shock'' and ``unscrupulous'' carry the same weight?

In the Washburn text, the word ``feel'' is the second-most salient one in the entire novel. The topic-modeling results reveal that the word ``feel'' occurs exclusively in the female-related themes, and is mentioned not once in a female-unrelated theme. Additionally, while five of the female-related themes also mention male-related words in them, only one of these contains the word ``feel.'' [This demonstrates that the inner life of women is given priority in Washburn's translation, and more importantly, in contexts where women are not surrounded by other men. Females are afforded a level of individuality that they are not in the other translations.] TODO comment was''This is where ``microanalysis'' (using human brain power) can come back in to make a contribution in supporting the contours of the big data [see end comments]''. This is evident in the Tyler translation, where the word majestic appears in four out of eight of the female themes (specifically the ones on courtship and ceremony), and only three times in all the other twelve, thereby indicating the presence of females as a cultural object for the purposes of courtly procedure and order. The Waley translation, by far, exhibits the most striking objectification and minimization of women ---Â women occur explicitly in themes about ceremony, palaces, and governance, thereby indicating a position in the text that is secondary to their male fathers and husbands. [TODO COMMENT: Similarly insightful. To extend the point for maximum impact: what do these additional associations tell us about the nature of that ``objectification and minimization''? i.e., the switch from an adjective or quality of class (``majestic'') to a set of physical places and cultural practices (``ceremony''). Ceremony appears in both Tyler and Waley, so how might it function differently in each?]
